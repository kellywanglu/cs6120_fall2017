## Important Announcement
[1/1/2017] We will have a quiz with 22 simple questions, 20 of them as True or False questions (relevant to probability, statistics, and linear algebra) in the first class (9/11/2017). This quiz will be graded, but will not be counted in your final score if you’re enrolled in CS6140. The purpose of this quiz is to indicate the expected background of students. 80% of the questions should be easy to answer. If you find yourself struggling with this quiz, it’s possible that you need to catch up on the background or it may be preferable to take one or two preliminary courses. For students previously do not take any algorithm course (CS 5800 or CS 7800, see Prerequisites), an 80% or above is required to enroll in this course.

## Course Description

#### Content
* 
* 

#### Textbooks and Reference
* Main Textbooks
 * Dan Jurafsky and James H. Martin, "Speech and Language Processing, 2nd Edition", Prentice Hall, 2000.
 * Third edition draft is available at [web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/](http://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/).
 
* Other Reference: 
 * Chris Manning and Hinrich Schütze, "Foundations of Statistical Natural Language Processing", MIT Press, 1999
 
* Since natural language processing problems are driven by machine learning techniques nowadays, we also encourage you to read machine learning textbooks:
 * Christopher M. Bishop, "Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning", Springer, 2006.
 * Tom Mitchell, "Machine Learning", McGraw Hill, 1997.
 
#### Prerequisites
This course is designed for graduate students majoring in computer science, linguistics, and other related areas. Students who take this course are expected to be able to write code in some programming languages (e.g., Python, Java, C/C++) proficiently, and finish courses in algorithms (CS 5800 or CS 7800), multivariable calculus, probability, statistics, and linear algebra.

## Grading
Each assignment or report, both electronic copy and hard copy, is due at the beginning of class on the corresponding due date. Hard copies are submitted in class. Assignment or report turned in late will be charged 10 points (out of 100 points) off for each late day (i.e. 24 hours). Each student has a budget of 5 days throughout the semester before a late penalty is applied. You may want to use it wisely, e.g. save for emergencies. 

Grades will be determined based on three assignments, ten in-class tests, one course project, one open-book exam, and participation:

* Assignments (30%): three assignments, each of 10%
* Quiz (9%): nine quick in-class tests, each of 1%
* Project (23%): team of 2 to 3 students, proposal (3%), reports (5%+10%), final presentation (5%, with 2% as bonus if selected as best project by peer students, and 1% as bonus for runner-up)
* Exam (35%): open-book
* Participation (3%): classes, Piazza
